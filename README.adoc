== structurizr-test

This repo serves as a test-bed for trying to create a template on how to work with the https://c4model.com/[C4 Model] with the "(Software-)Diagrams-As-Code" language https://docs.structurizr.com/dsl[Structurizr DSL], using the tools https://docs.structurizr.com/lite[structurizr-lite] for actually modelling and https://github.com/avisi-cloud/structurizr-site-generatr[structurizr-site-generatr] for creating the static webpage showcasing the model(s).

=== Setting up the tools

First, you'll need to install a Java Runtime and GraphViz as both softwares depend on these. +
It is possible to run these through containers as well, but this readme will focus on running these natively on a Windows-machine.
